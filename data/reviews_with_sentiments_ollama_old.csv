"Bought 2017 Optima Hybrid in November 17. It was the only Hybrid Optima on the lot out of dozens of gas ones. I had been comparing Accord, Camry, and Malibu Hybrids and read the Optima Hybrid got 46 mpg on the hwy. That was only 2 or 3 miles per gallon less than the best of them so I did some pricing. My choice was for the 26,800 premium with pretty standard features, good radio with Android Audio and SiriusXM, dual zone climate control, tilt, cruise control,pwr    windows and Door locks. At the time of purchase, there was a $5,000 rebate offered. I could not believe it. All this car for less than a Prius prime.  I have driven it to over 18k miles in 6 months after taking several trips and I really enjoy and appreciate this car. My first trip was from Phoenix to Vegas. Did it on one tank of gas. The car went 828 miles. Very impressive! Really like having a 6 speed transmission instead of a CVT. Driven properly there are days when it averages 60 to 61 mpg city hwy mix. It can go up to 80mph in electric mode. 10 year 100 k warranty and a 5star safety rating I think the value is unbeatable.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 98)

At 11k now in a lease for 39 months and it only gets 25mpg in city.  3 times dealerships say it just not broken in yet.  Do not buy!!! Very poor service follow up.  Filed case with corporate and still have yet to hear from them. Over a month now.,Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)
"I've owned BMW, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz in the lasts 10 years and have been shopping around for a PHEV for months. I was considering and test driving the Ford Fusion Energi, Chevy Volt, Totoyta Prius, Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, Huyndai Sonota Hybrid, Tesla Model S but finally traded in my Mercedes for a KIA Optima EX PHEV for its styling, infotaiment system, technologies, range, price/value ratio, long warranty. This car met all my expectations: stylish, smooth/quiet/comfortable interior, reasonable EV range. It did deliver the 29 all EV range as advertised. I've installed a 240V outlet and used an inexpensive level 2 charger I bought from Amazon.com for less than $250, it charged the car from empty to full battery in less than 3 hours.  Well done KIA!",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 98)
"Car does not get anywhere near advertised mileage, it varies depending on which gas station you use. but my V8 Mustang GT gets better mileage on the highway. The taillights fill with moisture all the time, had them replaced 8 times still do it. The trunk comes open when it wants, the bluetooth does not sync have the time. Worst of all is resell paid 36k after 10k miles it is worth $16,500 should have never switched from Toyota",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)

I don't think KIA knows what the term hybrid means!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can get a 6 cylinder Honda sedan that will give me the same mileage as this junk!  Passenger seat feels like your liteally sitting on the floor! you see jack from the seat!  The rear view from the drivers seat is a joke as well!,Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)
" I have sat in both the front and back seats and I there great. I have a bad neck and on long drives my neck never bothers me. This is coming from a man that traded in a Cadillac for the hybrid. The mileage is exactly what the review say, a bit lower than other of the same size, especially in colder weather. Overall though I am very happy with the car",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)
 The back seats are so laid back you cannot straighten yourself up.  The passenger front seat is so low that you feel like you are sitting in a pod.  If someone is seated behind this seat you cannot move it back either.  So most time your knees are touching the glove compartment.  It is exceptionally good with gas. All other things are ok in this car.,Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)
"Couple of things.. passenger seat is terribly low, radio has terrible sound, lighting is bad on instrument panel (red lights don‚Äôt show up well), seat track breaks every 20,000 miles. Mileage is effected by weather, lower mpg in cold weather. Hybrid gearing is dangerous. Starts with little hp In first gear. Slow to speed up.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 98)
3 times to the dealership with documented mileage.  No support or fix. I get 25mpg in city and about 33 on the hwy.  the hybrid doesn't work. It's running mostly off the engine. Dealerships excuses... it's just not broken in yet.  I now have 11k miles.   FAIL!!!  Do not by the hybrid.  My sisters non hybrid does just fine at 36/40 mpg,Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 98)
25mpg in the city 33 hwy on the 2016 ex hybrid. Taken it in twice stating poor mpg and was told it's just not broken in yet. I have 10k on it when is it going to break in?  Liars!!,Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)

"They changed the interior in the 2017. They did improve the comfort of the seats/headrest, but for me, they went backwards in terms of the interior styling- very bland and generic.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 97)
"Maybe it's just my car - and I know it has JD Power initial quality award for the segment - but I'm having a few issues that started when I initially got the car.  The door rattles, the dashboard makes noises in the heat - occasionally the temperature gauge starts out showing an exterior temp of 32 degrees even when it's well over 70, and sometimes the rear camera stays on ten second past pushing the car out of reverse into drive.  The car handles ok, acceleration is poor though.  Excellent use of space and nice panoramic roof...  No SMS notifications in infotainment system which my last two cars had...  This is my first Kia, and I'm disappointed - it will be my last - like I said before I was debating between a 2 and 3 year lease - I'm glad I went with the two year.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 98)
"A really good car; had a 2017 Premium with luxury pkg.  Missed some of the good stuff and traded it for a Limited, same year, after a month.  Really enjoy the added toys.  Only been driving this one for a week, but think it is a great car and glad I made the latest move.  Hard to find but definitely worth the effort.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 98)
"As my lease on my 2015 Chevy Malibu was almost up, I started car shopping and I HATE car salesmen.  I looked at several cars including buying a Malibu, Sonata, Cadillac and more, and I had a salesmen suggest I drive a  new 2017 Cadenza, which I did.  I am glad that I listed to him.  I loved the ride, but I was not going to pay $46K for the top of the line model.  The lease deal they had seemed great, but at the end of the day, it was still way too expensive.  I knew I wanted a 2017 Limited and preferably white.  I found a 2017 used (8200 miles) exactly like I wanted and I saved almost $17k from what it would have cost new.  I LOVE THIS CAR.  The ride is great, the looks are great and where I was concerned about my gas mileage (the Malibu averaged about 26 mpg around town and I got 32 mpg on the highway), this Cadenza is right there even though it's rated for only 20-28.  I drive it like there is an egg under my accelerator and once I get it up to speed, I just hold the gas pedal in place, I don't have to keep feeding it like I did on my Malibu.  On a recent highway trip I averaged 37 MPG (YES 37 MPG) and I am getting about 26 mpg around town.  What more could a buyer ask for?   Great Deal!!  Great Looking car!!!   Great MPG!!!  If you are looking for a nice upscale luxury type sedan, you need to look at the Cadenza.  I would highly suggest trying to find a used one and save yourself mega $$$$$.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 99)
"I've owned 3 lexus suv's and 1 sedan. The kia cadenza is very equal if not better then lexus. I'm very impressed with kia. Style, luxury, handling,pricing. Couldn't be more happier with my decision. As the old saying goes. Try it you may like it. Vinnie. New Jersey.",Error,Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 100)
