## **Project Overview**
This project tackles real-world datasets, focusing on data preparation, analysis, and visualization. It includes:
- Git repository management and collaboration.
- Data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Hugging Face models.
- Interactive dashboard creation with Plotly Dash for data storytelling.

### **Case Studies**
1. **Wine Stats**
2. **ICC Cricket World Cup Stats**
3. **Consumer Reviews on Clothing Products**

Our team worked on one of these case studies using provided datasets and guidelines.
